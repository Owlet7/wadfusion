Description             : A tool for combining all official id release
                          WADs into a single PK3 file playable with ZDoom
                          and its derivatives. Drop your WADs into the
                          source_wads\ subfolder, then run wadsmoosh.exe.
                          A new IWAD file called "doom_complete.pk3" will
                          be generated.
                          
                          Linux and macOS users can run from the included
                          source code with "./wadsmoo.sh".
                          
                          Program logs to wadsmoosh.log as it runs, any
                          errors it encounters will show up there.
                          
                          Master Levels map order can be customized in
                          masterlevels_order.txt.
                          
                          Advanced users can edit wadsmoosh_data.py to
                          customize what and how WadSmoosh extracts.

Inspirational Quote     : "As my son Steve says, just 'smoosh' it in there.
                          It's not a real word, but people seem to know
                          what it means." - Bob Ross

                          have texture errors, as WadSmoosh renames some of
                          the originals to prevent name conflicts.
